Day 4: Complete the Data Visualization dashboard and implement the Automation script

Objective: Complete the Data Visualization dashboard by adding any remaining visualizations and refining the layout. Implement a Python script to automate the data collection, processing, and analysis steps.

Step 1: Finish the Data Visualization dashboard

Complete any remaining data visualization components and integrate them into the dashboard layout.
Refine the layout, styling, and interactivity of the dashboard using React.py, HTML, and CSS.
Step 2: Implement the Automation script

Import the required libraries, such as Schedule and APScheduler, at the beginning of the script:
   import schedule
   from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler
Define a function to automate the data collection, processing, and analysis steps:
   def automate_data_pipeline(channel_ids):
       # Collect data
       channels, videos = fetch_data(channel_ids)

       # Save data
       save_data_to_csv(channels, videos)

       # Process and analyze data
       videos_df = pd.read_csv("videos.csv")
       videos_df = calculate_engagement_rates(videos_df)

       # Update the dashboard
       # This step will depend on the implementation of the dashboard using React.py
Schedule the automation function to run at regular intervals (e.g., daily) using Schedule or APScheduler:
   scheduler = BackgroundScheduler()
   scheduler.add_job(lambda: automate_data_pipeline(channel_ids), "interval", hours=24)
   scheduler.start()
Day 5: Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD and deploy the project on a Linux server (Debian)

Objective: Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) of the project. Deploy the project on a Linux server running Debian.

Step 1: Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Create a .github/workflows/main.yml file in the project repository.
Configure the GitHub Actions workflow to build, test, and deploy the project using the GitHub Actions documentation as a reference. For example:
   name: CI/CD

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Set up Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v2
           with:
             python-version: 3.9
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: pip install -r requirements.txt
         - name: Run tests
           run: pytest

     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       needs: build
       steps:
         - name: Deploy to server
           # Configure the deployment steps based on your chosen hosting provider
Step 2: Deploy the project on a Linux server (Debian)

Set up a Linux server running Debian with the required dependencies, such as Python and any necessary libraries.
Configure the server to run the project, including the Data Visualization dashboard and the Automation script.
Deploy the project to the server using the CI/CD pipeline set up with GitHub Actions.
Day 6-7: Debug, refine, and optimize the project

Objective: Debug, refine, and optimize the project. Perform final testing and update the GitHub repository.

Step 1: Debug and refine the project

Test the project thoroughly, identifying and fixing any bugs or issues.
Refine the project by making any necessary improvements to the code, visualizations, or layout.
Step 2: Optimize the project

Review the project to identify areas for optimization, such as improving the performance or efficiency of the data processing and analysis steps.
Implement any optimizations and test their effectiveness.
Step 3: Perform final testing and update the GitHub repository

Perform a final round of testing to ensure the project is working as expected.
Update the GitHub repository with the final version of the project, including any fixes, refinements, or optimizations made during Days 6 and 7.
By the end of Days 4-7, Mohamed should have a fully functional project, including a complete Data Visualization dashboard, an Automation script for data collection and analysis, and a CI/CD pipeline set up with GitHub Actions. The project should be deployed on a Linux server running Debian and thoroughly tested for any bugs or issues.
