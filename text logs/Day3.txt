Day 3: Data Processing and Analysis, and starting with Data Visualization dashboard

Objective: Create a Python script to process and analyze the collected data from the YouTube API, and start working on the Data Visualization dashboard using React.py, HTML, and CSS.

Part 1: Data Processing and Analysis

Step 1: Import required libraries and load the data

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load data from CSV files
channels_df = pd.read_csv("channels.csv")
videos_df = pd.read_csv("videos.csv")
Step 2: Define functions for data processing and analysis

def calculate_engagement_rates(videos_df):
    videos_df["engagement_rate"] = (videos_df["likeCount"] + videos_df["commentCount"]) / videos_df["viewCount"]
    return videos_df

def popular_video_categories(videos_df):
    categories = videos_df["title"].str.extract(r"\[(.*?)\]").squeeze().value_counts()
    return categories

def video_upload_frequency(videos_df):
    videos_df["publishedAt"] = pd.to_datetime(videos_df["publishedAt"])
    videos_df["date"] = videos_df["publishedAt"].dt.date
    frequency = videos_df.groupby("channelId")["date"].diff().value_counts().sort_index()
    return frequency
Step 3: Apply the functions to process and analyze the data

videos_df = calculate_engagement_rates(videos_df)
categories = popular_video_categories(videos_df)
upload_frequency = video_upload_frequency(videos_df)
Part 2: Start working on the Data Visualization dashboard

Step 1: Set up the React.py project

Create a new directory for the dashboard project and navigate to it in the terminal.
Initialize the project with React.py by running:
   python -m reactpy init
Open the index.py file in the project directory and start building the dashboard using React.py, HTML, and CSS.
Step 2: Create components for data visualizations

Import the required libraries for data visualization, such as Plotly, at the beginning of the index.py file:
   import plotly.express as px
Create a function to generate a bar chart for popular video categories:
   def render_category_chart(categories):
       fig = px.bar(categories, x=categories.index, y=categories.values, labels={"x": "Category", "y": "Count"})
       return fig.to_html(full_html=False)
Create additional functions to generate other visualizations, such as line charts for video upload frequency and engagement rates.
Step 3: Integrate the visualizations into the dashboard

Create a layout for the dashboard using React.py, HTML, and CSS, and incorporate the visualization components created in Step 2.
By the end of Day 3, Mohamed should have a working Python script for data processing and analysis, and he should have started working on the Data Visualization dashboard using React.py, HTML, and CSS. The dashboard should include components for various visualizations to help users understand the channel performance insights.
