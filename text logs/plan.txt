Since you're new to everything, I'll guide you through setting up a simple project using React for the frontend and Python with Flask for the backend. This will give you a good starting point to build upon and add more features as you progress.

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended).
2. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.6 or newer).

### Setting up the Frontend (React)

1. Open a terminal/command prompt and run the following command to install `create-react-app`, a tool for creating new React projects:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

2. Create a new React project by running the following command:

```bash
create-react-app my-web-app
```

Replace `my-web-app` with your desired project name.

3. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd my-web-app
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Now you should see your new React app running at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

### Setting up the Backend (Python & Flask)

1. Open a new terminal/command prompt and create a new directory for your backend:

```bash
mkdir my-web-app-backend
```

Replace `my-web-app-backend` with your desired backend project name.

2. Change to the backend project directory:

```bash
cd my-web-app-backend
```

3. Create a virtual environment for your backend project:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install Flask:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

6. Create a new file named `app.py` in the `my-web-app-backend` directory with the following content:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

7. Start the Flask development server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Now you should see your Flask app running at `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

### Connecting Frontend and Backend

1. In your `my-web-app` directory, install Axios for making API calls from the frontend to the backend:

```bash
npm install axios
```

2. Open the `src/App.js` file in your `my-web-app` directory and replace its content with the following:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function App() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:5000');
        setMessage(response.data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>{message}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This code will fetch data from the Flask backend and display it on the frontend.

3. Restart your React development server (if it's not running):

```bash
npm start
```

Now you should see the message "Hello, World!" from the Flask backend displayed in your React app at `http://localhost:3000`.

You have now set up a basic project with React for the frontend and Python with Flask for the backend. You can build upon this foundation by adding more features, such as state management, routing, and API calls, as you learn more about web development.
